# Task 1

## Overview of Problem 

### Soft Drink Delivery Times Problem
* Goal: estimation of the required time needed by each employee to refill an automatic vending machines owned and served by the company. 
* For this reason, a small quality assurance study was set-up by an industrial engineer of the company. 
  * As the response variable he considered the `total service time` (measured in minutes) of each machine, including its stocking with beverage products and any required maintenance or housekeeping. 
  * After examining the problem, the industrial engineer recommended two important variables which affect delivery time:  

1. the `number of cases of stocked products` and   
2. the `distance walked by the employee` (measured in feet).  

A dataset of *25 observations* was collected.  

### JAGS Model

* Since the 
* The *linear predictor* of this data are the `cases` and `distance` variables  
* Since the *predicted variable* `time` is interval data, therefore:
  * The *link* function will be linear $\mu = lin(x)$
  * the *Metric* scale will be used. 
  * Since the Metric scale is used, a typical *noise distribution* for Metric scale types of predicted variables is normally distributed, or $y$ ~ $N(\mu, \sigma)$

    # modelâ€™s likelihood 
    for (i in 1:n) { 
      time[i] ~ dnorm( mu[i], tau ) # stochastic componenent 
      
      # link and linear predictor 
      # In JAGS, ilogit is logistic. Use logistic since not 0/1 predicted values
      mu[i] <- beta0 + (beta1 * cases[i]) + (beta2 * distance[i])
