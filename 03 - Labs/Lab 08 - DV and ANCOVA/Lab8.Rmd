# Task 2: Interpretation - (Unequal Salary Dataset)


  Find parameter point and interval estimates. Interpret them!
```{r 2, eval=TRUE}
est.lm <- lm(salary ~ years + GM + years:GM)
summary(est.lm)
```
  
  
## Interpretation of Interaction Results:

#### 1. If `x` is increased by one unit what happens to the  mean value of `y`?
a. For each year increased, a male is paid the value of $beta3$ (which on the iteration before this was 10.098, it changes since it is MCMC) more than a female (thousand dollars? units not known since link is broken to data).
  b. E.g., in year 2, a male will make 10.098 $\times$ 2 more than the female on average. 
  
#### 2. Will the lines ever `intersect` over the range of the data?
a. No, the lines will never intersect
  
#### 3. Interpret the slope:
a. The slope of the interaction term means the amount more that is paid to males than females, given years of experience. 
b. The slope of years is the amount paid to males, given years of experience.
c. This should hover around 10. See $beta3$ normal density plot to get a sense of the potential variation.
  
#### 4. Use `point interval estimation` (classical medthods) to answer question 1:
a. For each year increased, a male is paid 10.00 more than a female.
  
#### 5. Interpret `Bayesian Credibility Intervals`
a. There is a 95% probability that a male is paid 14.210 or less than a female (since MCMC likely to vary from above output).

# Task 3: Plot Model (Unequal Salary Dataset)

  Plot the data and the estimating lines
```{r 3, eval=TRUE}
# Plot salary on years of experience
plot(salary~years)

# List of coefficients from model above (classical)
cf2 = coef(est.lm)

# Plot the slope of each male and female

## Task 2: Interpretation - (Equal Salary Dataset)

  Find parameter point and interval estimates. Interpret them!

### Interpretation of Interaction Results:

#### 1. If `x` is increased by one unit what happens to the  mean value of `y`?
a. For each year increased, a male is paid $beta3$ (which on the iteration before this was 0.1916, it changes since it is MCMC) more than a female (thousand dollars? units not known since link is broken to data).
b. E.g., in year 2, a male will make 0.1916 $\times$ 2 more than the female on average.
c. This should hover around 0. See $beta3$ normal density plot to get a sense of the potential variation. 
  
#### 2. Will the lines ever intersect over the range of the data?
a. No, the lines will never intersect, but they run nearly parallel, hence "equal" 
  
#### 3. What meaning does the slope have?
a. The slope of the interaction term means the amount more that is paid to males than females, given years of experience. 
b. The slope of years is the amount paid to males, given years of experience.
  
#### 4. Use `point interval estimation` (classical medthods) to answer question 1:
a. For each year increased, a male is paid 0.200 more than a female.
  
#### 5. Interpret BCI's (Bayesian credible intervals) -- these are probability intervals and NOT Confidence Intervals.
a. There is a 95% probability that a male is paid 0.9383 or less than a female  (since MCMC likely to vary from above output).

## Task 3 Plot Model (Equal Salary Dataset

```{r 3b, eval=TRUE}
